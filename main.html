  				<div class="gameCaption"><p>
  					Etrian Odyssey is a series in which the hero is responsible for exploring
  					and mapping out every floor of a deep, multi-level dungeon. This Square Enix title
  					is notorious for it's difficulty. Even the so-called "picnic" mode will have you
  					repeating dungeons to grind for items and experience. The Fafnir Knight stood 
  					out to me due to it's story mode which was reminisent of old-school Fire Emblem.

  					I haven't finished Fire Emblem Echoes but I love Celica.

  				<div class="gameCaption"> <img src="./images/Tactician_Kris.png"><p>
  					I married Libra, in case you were wondering. Awakening is a treasure. It was my second
  					fire emblem game but I played it a ton of times and filled out quite a bit of the support log.

  			<div class="game">
  				<img src="./images/Bravely_Second.jpg" class="gameImage">
  				<div class="gameCaption"><p>
  					Bravely Default is a tactical RPG with a complex class system.
  					Using your four main charatcers, you gather skills from classes
  					you're leveled in that you can keep for the rest of the game.
  					It has some very cute characters, but the combat and plot have
  					been criticized for repetition. To deal with the grind, I suggest
  					setting the encounter rate to max and using auto-battle mode.
  				</p></div>

  			<div class="game">
  				<img src="./images/Rune_Factory_4.jpg" class="gameImage">
  				<div class="gameCaption"><p>
  					Rune Factory 4 is an extremely addicting game. I have been a long time fan of the Harvest
  					Moon series since it's Nintendo 64 Days, and I was delighted to place this game and
  					see just how far the team has come. Rune Factory combines all the best features of farming with
  					a battle-RPG in which you recruit and raise monsters for your farm, including monster cows and chickens
  					that become your livestock.

  			<div class="game">
  				<img src="./images/Infinite_Undiscovery.jpg" class="gameImage">
  				<div class="gameCaption"><p>
  					This is a nice weird one I picked up for $7 at a used Game Store in Michigan. The world-building and
  					maps are amazing, but it is detrimented by a couple of mediocre game mechanics. I think a remake is what 
  					this game needs to further explore the world of those blessed by the Moon.
  				</p></div>

  			<div class="game">
  				<img src="./images/Okami.jpg" class="gameImage">
  				<div class="gameCaption"><p>
  					Okami is the best game I have played in my entire life. I would highly recommend playing
  					it on the wii simply for the interactions. The game is beautiful, thoughtful, and large. There's
  					a giant world to explore, tons of side-quests to do, and a compelling story that makes you keep
  					coming back to this game. There was one time when I spent 72 hours straight awake in my life, and
  					it was the summer that I played this game. 
  				</p></div>

  			<div class="game">
  				<img src="./images/Tales_Of_Symphonia_2.jpg" class="gameImage">
  				<div class="gameCaption"><p>
  					I have replayed Tales of Symphonia 2 multiple times and I still haven't
  					found out all of the secrets hidden in the game. I admittedly played this before the original, and I
  					am still very in love with the story of Dawn of the New World. There is a lot of great character conflict and
  					I also enjoyed raising and taming monsters. My biggest complaint is a lack of data and intuition on how 
  					monsters grow. Still, Marta and Emil are some of my favorite protagonists ever.
